## Problem Statement
For this project, you will be making a full CRUD app using the technologies outlined below. When thinking of an app idea, try to frame the project in terms of trying to solve a "problem" and think about the purpose of the app, who would use it, etc. The problem doesn't have to be anything intense and can be something small and simple! For example: 

  >**Problem:** I have a huge enamel pin collection and want to organize it all in one place<br> 
  >**General App Idea/Purpose:** An app that allows me to catalogue all my pins by category <br>
  >**Who Would Use It:** Pin collectors
